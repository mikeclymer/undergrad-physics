# Undergraduate Physics

This project encapsulates the undergraduate physics program being followed in my learning journey.

> [!NOTE]
> The vast majority of the curriculum comes from Susan Rigetti's excellent guide - [So You Want to Learn Physics â€¦
> SECOND EDITION](https://www.susanrigetti.com/physics)
>
> Additional resources from other guides will be added as needed.

Project documentation can be found [here](site/index.html)
